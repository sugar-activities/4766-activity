1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:04,800
Copying is not theft.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,500
Copying is not theft.

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,500
Stealing a thing leaves one less left

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,000
Copying it makes one thing more;

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,500
that's what copying's for.

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,000
Copying is not theft

7
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,000
If I copy yours you have it too

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,750
One for me and one for you

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,000
That's what copies can do

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,700
If I steal your bicycle

11
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,000
you have to take the bus,

12
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,900
but if I just copy it

13
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,100
there's one for each of us!

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,300
Making more of a thing,

15
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,300
that is what we call "copying"

16
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,700
Sharing ideas with everyone

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
That's why copying

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,500
is FUN
